        "Efficient water management is a cornerstone of precision farming, especially in resource-scarce environments. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate soil moisture levels at unsensed field locations using limited sensor data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to reduce dependency on extensive soil moisture sensors, making precision farming more cost-effective and scalable.\n",
